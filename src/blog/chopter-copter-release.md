It's time to chopter 'til you dropter!

Chopter Copter is now officially available for the [Playdate Catalog](https://play.date/games/chopter-copter/).

You can grab it from the link above, or by browsing the catalog on your Playdate device. We've also updated the [itch.io version](https://sadfolks.itch.io/chopter-copter) to include some of the quality of life updates and minor improvements that've been added to the Catalog version.

If you missed out on the news, you can also listen to and purchase the soundtrack for Chopter Copter at [Zan-zan's Bandcamp](https://zan-zan-zawa-veia.bandcamp.com/album/chopter-copter-ost)

It's been quite the journey and we're incredibly excited to be here! We can't wait for you all to experience Chopter Copter for the first time, or to dive back in for a few more rounds if you're a returning player.

Whether you've played the itch.io version and are returning for a few more rounds, or you're a totally new player experiencing Chopter Copter for the first time, we can't wait for you to dive in.

Until next time, folks!
