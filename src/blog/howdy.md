We're Sad Folks Interactive, a small group of artists, musicians, and developers coming together to create video games. Initially just a handful of ideas and concepts formed between friends an ocean apart, Sad Folks Interactive has been bringing them to life since its inception!

We're currently on the verge of releasing our first commercial game, titled "Chopter Copter" for the [Playdate Catalog](https://play.date/games/), and we're in the preliminary stages of hashing out our next projects.

In the meantime, why not check out some of our [earlier freeware](https://lagdotcom.itch.io/diggin-it) and [jam prototypes](https://lagdotcom.itch.io/poisoned-daggers) to tide you over? We'd love to hear what you think!
