What's up, folks!

Only five days left til the big Playdate Catalog release of Chopter Copter! To celebrate, we've decided to give your ears something fun to do today and released the soundtrack a bit early (or maybe a little late if you're already a big fan of the itch.io version) over at [Zan-zan's Bandcamp page](https://zan-zan-zawa-veia.bandcamp.com/album/chopter-copter-ost).

Until next time, folks. Keep on choppin' on!
