Hey again, folks!

That's right, we're only a week away from launching Chopter Copter for the Playdate Catalog! This version of the game includes a new global leaderboard exclusive to it, but rest assured: if you grabbed the game on itch.io we'll also be updating it with a couple of adjustments. These include:

- Increased character limit for score entry
- Fancy new screen transition
- Adjustment to the scoring system that now adds to your score for each minute survived
