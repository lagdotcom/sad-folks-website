## Jacob "UltraJDude" Ritz

Design, Writing, Art, Music &amp; Studio Operations

### About

Born, raised, and still living where Sad Folks Interactive was founded - Jacob's body, soul, and skeleton are estimated to be comprised of at least 90% video games. A former speedrunner and let's player, Jacob eventually took up the indie dev mantle; his first project was music, writing, and general tuning on [Studio Anjin](https://www.studio-anjin.co.uk/)'s ["The Midnight Station"](https://studioanjin.itch.io/the-midnight-station). He continues moonlighting as a musician and more for other indie titles, including: [Nanokin](https://www.studio-anjin.co.uk/nanokin/), Malison: The Cursed City, and [The Unlife of Gorlak](https://landsharkrawr.itch.io/the-unlife-of-gorlak). At Sad Folks Interactive, Jacob largely works on concepts and art while dabbling in a little bit of everything else, likely driving his friends and co-workers to the brink of madness with lofty goals and weird ideas.

### Favorite Things

Final Fantasy VII (PS1), Mother 3 (GBA), metal music, home cooked meals

## Paul "Lag.Com" Davies

Programming

### About

Lag has written some code every day for over 30 years and he doesn't plan on stopping yet. While he mainly focuses on implementing whatever insanity the other team members come up with, occasional sparks of creativity make it to the surface. At any given moment, he is thinking about Dungeons &amp; Dragons, roguelikes, dungeon crawlers or roguelike dungeon crawling D&amp;D games.

### Favorite Things

Final Fantasy IX, tabletop roleplaying, trading cards, scotch eggs

## Emily "MercuryZelda" Davies

Writing

### About

An American who made their way to Britain by way of husband Lag.Com, Mercury spends most of their time [knitting](https://www.mercurialknits.com) but used to dream of being a writer. With Sad Folks Interactive, they're getting the chance to live out that dream. They're hoping to add character interactions and further lore to a full version of "Poisoned Daggers".

### Favorite Things

The Beatles, The Legend of Zelda series (especially Wind Waker and Minish Cap), hand-dyed yarn, Italian and Japanese food
